# Fiserv Programathon Android Lab
Android training lab for Fiserv Programathon competitors.

This repository contains the final state of the code that was shown in a "lab training" for the competitors of the 2019 Fiserv Programathon contest. This sample app was implemented step by step in front of said competitors to teach them the basics about Android, but the code was shared at the end of the session so competitors could have access to it after the session for further exploration and analysis.
